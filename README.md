## Overview of the statistical analysis:

We will use SQLalchemy to do real time analysis on the data provided to determine if our clients ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

## Results:

The main difference in minimum temperature in June the minimum is 64 *F but in december it drops to 56 *F which is roughly 13.5 *C, I personally believe 13*C is too cold for icecream and those days in December would be very slow. 



## Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)
